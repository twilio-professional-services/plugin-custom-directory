# Flex Custom Directory Plugin

This plugin implements a *Custom Transfers Directory* tab in the [Twilio Flex](https://www.twilio.com/flex) [Native Dialpad](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/dialpad). It includes code for [Twilio Functions](https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/functions) as well as frontend UI code in the form of a [Flex plugin](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/quickstart/getting-started-plugin).

## Setup

### Prerequisites
Before beginning with this Flex plugin, you'll want to make sure that:
- You have a working [Twilio Flex](https://www.twilio.com/flex) account
- You have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as well as [`npm`](https://npmjs.com) installed
  - `npm` generally gets installed along with Node.js, but make sure you have it anyway
- You have the latest [Twilio CLI](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/quickstart) installed
- Your Twilio CLI is running the latest [Serverless Plugin](https://github.com/twilio-labs/plugin-serverless)

### Workers
This plugin assumes a simple one-to-many _Team_ structure – all workers must have a single _Team Leader_. That _Team Leader's_ Worker SID must be populated in their `team_leader_sid` worker attribute. Here is an example of a worker's attributes containing this value:

``` json
{
  "contact_uri": "client:redshirt",
  "full_name": "Red Shirt",
  "image_url": "https:\\/\\/p199.p4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com\\/items\\/8Lu7y5on\\/Image%202020-06-09%20at%209.36.09%20AM.jpg",
  "email": "no-reply@twilio.com",
  "roles": [
    "agent"
  ],
  "team_lead_sid": "WKf4cbd765a0ed1c0fee5b3bb655e1c851"
}
```

### Configuration
Over the course of the configuration process, you'll need several values from your Twilio account. The first three can be found right now in the Twilio Console, but the last one will require you to deploy your Twilio Functions to find (Don't worry, we'll cover that!)

- Account SID
  - Found on the [Twilio Console Homepage](https://www.twilio.com/console)
  - String starting with "AC..."
- Auth Token
  - Found on the [Twilio Console Homepage](https://www.twilio.com/console)
  - Secure string of 32 characters that we'll call "blah..." for the sake of communication
- Workspace ID
  - Found in your [TaskRouter Dashboard](https://www.twilio.com/console/taskrouter/dashboard)
  - String starting with "WS..."
- Serverless Runtime Domain
  - We'll grab this after we've deployed our Twilio Functions
  - A web domain that looks something like "foobar-xxx-dev.twilio.io"

We'll be entering these values into three files, some of which don't exist yet:
- public/appConfig.js
- serverless/.env
- src/config.js

#### public/appConfig.js
To kick things off, rename the example app configuration file to remove `.example`, then open it in your editor of choice

```bash
mv public/appConfig.example.js public/appConfig.js

vim public/appConfig.js
```

You'll notice that this file has a temporary string variable for your Account Sid. Replace that string with your actual value.

```javascript
# Before:
var accountSid = 'accountSid';

# After
var accountSid = 'AC...';
```
#### serverless/.env
Next, we'll need to configure the environment variables for the Twilio Functions. Start by renaming the environment file to remove `.example` and opening it with your editor:

```bash
mv serverless/.env.example serverless/.env

vim serverless/.env
```

Now, just like before, replace the temporary strings with your actual values

```
# Before
ACCOUNT_SID=accountSid
AUTH_TOKEN=authToken
TWILIO_WORKSPACE_SID=workspaceSid

# After
ACCOUNT_SID=AC...
AUTH_TOKEN=blah...
TWILIO_WORKSPACE_SID=WS...
```

#### Deploying Functions

Before we can configure the last file, we'll need to deploy our Twilio Functions and grab the Runtime Domain. To do so, we'll be using the [Twilio CLI](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/quickstart) and the [Serverless Plugin](https://github.com/twilio-labs/plugin-serverless) that you installed as a prerequisiste.

First off, make sure that you have authenticated according to the [Twilio CLI documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/quickstart#login-to-your-twilio-account).

Then cd into the Functions directory and deploy them:

```bash
cd src/Functions
twilio serverless:deploy
```

Once everything gets deployed, your response should look something like this:

```bash
Deployment Details
Domain: foobar-xxx-dev.twilio.io
Service:
   custom-transfer-directory (ZS...)
Environment:
   dev (ZE...)
Build SID:
   ZB...
View Live Logs:
   Open the Twilio Console
Functions:
   [protected] https://foobar-xxx-dev.twilio.io/getTeamMembers
Assets:
```

The value we're looking for comes after `Domain:` – that's your Runtime Domain.

#### config.js

Now open `src/config.js` in your text editor. Notice the runtime domain set to a default value? Let's change that:

```javascript
# Before:
export default {
    runtimeDomain: "http://localhost:3000"
}

# After:
export default {
    runtimeDomain: "https://foobar-xxx-dev.twilio.io"
}

```

And now your plugin is fully configured! You can now run it locally to test and customize it, or build it into a package and upload it to your Twilio Assets for hosted use.

## Local Development/Deployment

In order to develop locally, you can use the Webpack Dev Server by running:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will automatically start up the Webpack Dev Server and open the browser for you. Your app will run on `http://localhost:3000`. If you want to change that you can do this by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
PORT=3001 npm start
```

When you make changes to your code, the browser window will be automatically refreshed.

## Deploy

Once you are happy with your plugin, you have to bundle it in order to deploy it to Twilio Flex.

Run the following command to start the bundling:

```bash
npm run build
```

Afterwards, you'll find in your project a `build/` folder that contains a file with the name of your plugin project. For example, `plugin-example.js`. Take this file and upload it into the Assets part of your Twilio Runtime.

Note: Common packages like `React`, `ReactDOM`, `Redux` and `ReactRedux` are not bundled with the build because they are treated as external dependencies so the plugin will depend on Flex to provide them globally.
